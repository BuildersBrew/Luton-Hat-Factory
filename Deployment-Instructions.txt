=== Deployment Instructions ===

 - On a new domain
The folder should be able to be hosted as-is. This is the recommended way we build our apps.
There is only one webpage included here, index.html
The simplest way to host would be to connect that page to its own domain
A link from your existing website can send you to that domain, the app will on page load

 - On an existing site
If you would like to integrate this app into an existing website you will need to edit its source html
Hopefully your web developer is able to edit the site source, depending on if you use a website creator tool like
Wordpress, Wix, Webflow, etc... that might be tricky or not allowed at all (your only option will be to host a new website).

So long as the paths to the files provided are referencing each other you should be able to call 'Template/app.js' 
from a custom location. A canvas element with id="unity-canvas" is what the app will draw to.

We use the Unity Engine to build our WebGL apps. If you need more information, searching how to host a 
Unity WebGL build might reveal anything we've missed here.


A temporary link to the app can be found below, we will keep it live until you have successfully hosted the app yourself
